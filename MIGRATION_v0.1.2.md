## Upgrade Instructions

To upgrade from v0.1.1 to v0.1.2, update the dependency in your go.mod file:

```go
require (
    go.fork.vn/log v0.1.2
)
```

This is a minor release with no breaking changes. All existing code will continue to work without modifications. The main improvements are related to testing infrastructure, performance monitoring, and code quality.

## New Testing Capabilities

### Running Benchmarks

The following commands can be used to run the newly added benchmarks:

```bash
# Run all benchmarks with memory statistics
go test -bench=. -benchmem

# Run specific component benchmarks
go test -bench=BenchmarkServiceProvider -benchmem
go test -bench=BenchmarkManager -benchmem 
go test -bench=BenchmarkConfig -benchmem

# Generate performance profiles
go test -bench=. -cpuprofile=cpu.prof -memprofile=mem.prof
```

### Benchmark Categories

1. **Creation Benchmarks**: Object instantiation performance
2. **Validation Benchmarks**: Configuration validation speed
3. **Operation Benchmarks**: Core functionality performance
4. **Concurrency Benchmarks**: Parallel operation testing
5. **Memory Benchmarks**: Allocation and usage tracking
6. **Edge Case Benchmarks**: Worst-case scenario performance
