# Migration Guide - v0.1.2

## Overview
This guide helps you migrate from v0.1.1 to v0.1.2. The good news is that **no code changes are required** - this release is 100% backward compatible and focuses on enhanced testing infrastructure and performance monitoring.

## Prerequisites
- Go 1.23 or later
- go.fork.vn/log v0.1.1 or earlier

## Quick Migration Checklist
- [x] Update dependencies (only step required)
- [x] Run tests to ensure compatibility
- [x] No code changes needed
- [x] Optionally run new benchmark tests

## Breaking Changes
**None** - This release maintains full backward compatibility.

## Step-by-Step Migration

### Step 1: Update Dependencies
The only change required is updating your dependencies:

```bash
go get go.fork.vn/log@v0.1.2
# Note: No need to update config and di - this release doesn't require newer versions
go mod tidy
```

### Step 2: Verify Compatibility
Run your tests to ensure everything works as expected:

```bash
go test ./...
```

### Step 3: Optional - Run New Benchmark Tests
Take advantage of the new comprehensive benchmark suite:

```bash
# Run all benchmarks with memory profiling
go test -bench=. -benchmem

# Run specific component benchmarks
go test -bench=BenchmarkServiceProvider -benchmem
go test -bench=BenchmarkManager -benchmem
go test -bench=BenchmarkConfig -benchmem

# Generate performance profiles
go test -bench=. -cpuprofile=cpu.prof -memprofile=mem.prof
```

### Step 4: Optional - Leverage Enhanced Testing Infrastructure
Your existing code continues to work unchanged:

```go
// Your existing logging code remains the same:
logger := log.NewManager()
logger.Info("Application started")

// Enhanced benchmark testing capabilities are now available
// (see documentation for performance testing patterns)
```

## What Changed Internally
While your code doesn't need to change, here's what improved under the hood:

### Enhanced Testing Infrastructure
- **Before**: Basic test coverage
- **After**: Comprehensive benchmark suite with memory profiling
- **Impact**: Better performance monitoring and testing capabilities

### Improved Code Quality
- Resolved all static analysis warnings
- Enhanced mock management for reliable testing
- Better error handling in test scenarios
- Fixed unused variable warnings in benchmarks

## Common Issues and Solutions
Since this is a fully compatible release, you shouldn't encounter any issues. However:

### Issue: Build Errors After Update
**Unlikely Problem**: Build fails after dependency update  
**Solution**: 
```bash
go clean -modcache
go mod download
go mod tidy
```

### Issue: Test Failures
**Unlikely Problem**: Existing tests fail  
**Solution**: This shouldn't happen, but if it does:
1. Check if you're using internal/private APIs (not recommended)
2. Ensure all dependencies are properly resolved

## Getting Help
- Check the [documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/go.fork.vn/log@v0.1.2)
- Search [existing issues](https://github.com/go-fork/log/issues)
- Create a [new issue](https://github.com/go-fork/log/issues/new) if needed

## Rollback Instructions
If you need to rollback (though it shouldn't be necessary):

```bash
go get go.fork.vn/log@v0.1.1
go mod tidy
```

## Benefits of Upgrading
- Enhanced performance monitoring through comprehensive benchmark suite
- Better testing infrastructure for development and CI/CD
- Improved code quality and reliability
- Foundation for future performance optimizations
